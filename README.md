A powershell script for convenient Windows backups using Drive Snapshot (http://www.drivesnapshot.de/en/index.htm)

why Drive Snapshot?
===================

Drive Snapshot is a very nice imaging utility for Windows. It saves complete systems to image files during

Why this script?
================

Drive Snapshot contains only the basic functions, for complete automation of the backup strategy we need a script.
